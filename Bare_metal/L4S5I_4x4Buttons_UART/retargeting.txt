How to use printf()

create a new project
enable UART2 and generate code


to retarget the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR standard streams to the STM32 USART2.

The simplest and effective solution is to redefine the needed system calls (_write(), _read(), _isatty(), _close(), _fstat()) to retarget the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR standard streams to the STM32 USART2. This can be easily done in the following way

Copy the file "retarget.h" into the "Inc" folder, and the file "retarget.c" into the "Src" folder.

include the header files "retarget.h" and "stdio.h" into the main.c file

add the line "RetargetInit(&huart2);" into you main() function after initializing UART2, i.e., MX_USART2_UART_Init();.

comment out the rewritten system calls

To be able to use float numbers in the printf function, go to Project>Properties>C/C++ Build>Settings>MCU/MPU Settings and enable "Use float with printf from newlib-nano (-u _printf_float)
